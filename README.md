Mining-And-Construction-Kit
===========================

Mining and Construction ToolKit. A helping hand for some of those tedious and dangerous Minecraft tasks.

This mod contains no ores.
This mod contains no mobs.
This mod contains no biomes.

This mod lets you use all those flowers that you find to create liquid dye.

Disclaimer

This is my first mod.
I do not know Java very well.
I'm learning :)

I've taken classes from CoFHLib to help with all the tedious stuff.
I've also taken some classes from CoFHCOre (bucket handlers!).
I've used CoFH in general as a guide on how to structure a mod.
